- 👋 Hi, I’m Joseph Joe but people call me by my last name "Joe" which I don't prefer but now not calling me "Joe" is kinda weird

- 👀 I’m interested in Software Programming, I wanna be in an environment where I can improve and diversify my skills.
I am competent and commited to my work. I am always curious and try to understand how most things work and prefer to listen to
facts.

- 💞️ I’m willing to learn any Programming Language, I believe that whats improtant in this industry is to learn how to learn. 
The more you know, the more you dont know and I think thats just how it works. I think the important part of learning a language
is to learn the concepts and apllications of that language becase lets face it, its impossible to know everything.

- 💻 Projects I've worked on are at my resume and repo

- 📫 How to reach me ...
